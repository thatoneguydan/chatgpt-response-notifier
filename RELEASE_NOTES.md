# ChatGPT Response Notifier 0.9.82

- Unifies the timer surface so the notifier owns one full-width, black, right-aligned and wrapping countdown with a separate Stop control. Stop cancels the current timer while Monitor stays enabled.
- Keeps a definitive `PLANNING_ACTIVE`, `COMPLETE_APPLIED`, `COMPLETE_NO_CHANGES`, or `BLOCKED_HUMAN` stop parked through late same-turn request and action events.
- Routes a stream read failure through an exact request-and-turn-bound rendered-status observation. The test-toast button now waits for the Windows helper to confirm actual presentation.
- Updates Quick Continue 1.2.19 to preserve exact line breaks through editor insertion, avoid hidden composer selection, and ignore countdown-only toolbar mutations.

## Previous: 0.9.81

- Fixes the live `COMPLETE_APPLIED` miss reproduced on Glass when a long-running ChatGPT response crosses an extension update boundary.
- Preserves an already-observed terminal footer when Chrome throws while finishing a cloned SSE response; a late stream read error can no longer erase the status token before the worker parks the watchdog.
- Reinstalls the current status parser and terminal page authority into already-open ChatGPT tabs after an extension update, then forces bounded rechecks so a response already in progress is still evaluated by the new runtime.
- Repeats that bounded terminal refresh after a `stream-read-error`, covering the exact failure path observed in live runtime evidence without adding ChatGPT polling or extra requests.
- Keeps the 0.9.80 watchdog rules: definitive COMPLETE/BLOCKED/PLANNING statuses stop the timer, and a later trusted manual / Continue / Project send explicitly starts a new 30-minute timer.
